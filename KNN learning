    "\n",
    "**1. Definition**  \n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It is a **non-parametric** and **instance-based** algorithm, meaning it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution and relies directly on training data for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Basic Idea**  \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN works based on the principle that **similar data points exist close to each other in feature space**.  \n",
    "To predict the label of a new data point, the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculates the distance between the new point and all training points.\n",
    "2. Selects the **K** nearest neighbors (where K is a user-defined integer).\n",
    "3. For **classification**, assigns the most common class among neighbors.  \n",
    "    For **regression**, takes the average (or weighted average) of the neighbors’ values.\n",

    "- Computationally expensive for large datasets (requires distance calculation with all points).\n",
