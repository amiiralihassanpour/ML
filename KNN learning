Definition**  \n\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It is a **non-parametric** and **instance-based** algorithm, meaning it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution and relies directly on training data for predictions.\n\n---\n\n**2. Basic Idea**  \n\nKNN works based on the principle that **similar data points exist close to each other in feature space**.  \nTo predict the label of a new data point, the algorithm:\n\n1. Calculates the distance between the new point and all training points.\n2. Selects the **K** nearest neighbors (where K is a user-defined integer).\n3. For **classification**, assigns the most common class among neighbors.  \n    For **regression**, takes the average (or weighted average) of the neighbors’ values.\n    NOTE: K is a hyperparameter.\n\n---\n\n**3. Common Distance Metrics**\n\n- **Euclidean Distance:**  \n$$\n( d(p, q) = \\sqrt{\\sum (p_i - q_i)^2} )  \n$$\n- **Manhattan Distance:**      \n$$\n    ( d(p, q) = \\sum |p_i - q_i| )\n$$\n- **Minkowski Distance:** Generalization of the above two.\n\n---\n\n**4. Choosing the Value of K**\n\n- Small K → more sensitive to noise (overfitting).\n- Large K → smoother decision boundary but may include unrelated points (underfitting).\n- K is often chosen via **cross-validation**.\n\n---\n\n**5. Advantages**\n\n- Simple to understand and implement.\n- No training phase; the model adapts quickly to new data.\n- Works well with small datasets and nonlinear boundaries.\n\n---\n\n**6. Disadvantages**\n\n- Computationally expensive for large datasets (requires distance calculation with all points).\n- Performance depends heavily on feature scaling (normalization or standardization is necessary).\n- Sensitive to irrelevant or correlated features.\n- Poor performance in high-dimensional data (curse of dimensionality).\n\n---\n\n**7. Applications**\n\n- Pattern recognition (e.g., handwriting or image classification)\n- Recommendation systems\n- Medical diagnosis\n- Credit scoring\n\n---\n\n**8. Implementation Example (Python / scikit-learn)**\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n\n# Load dataset\nX, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Initialize and train the model\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)\nknn.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict and evaluate\naccuracy = knn.score(X_test, y_test)\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nKNN is a simple yet powerful algorithm that classifies data based on proximity in feature space. However, it is best suited for smaller datasets and requires proper preprocessing (like scaling) and careful choice of **K** to perform effectively.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Topic \nour topic in this project is **Iris classification using KNN**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
